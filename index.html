        Who am I
      </h2>
      <p>
        I'm a thirsty years old guy passionate about web development and entrepreneurship. I'm also a PC gamer, casual guitarist and (red, red) wine enjoyer. I'm born in Theux, near Li√®ge, where I've done my studies and have one office while I was a startup entrepreneur, incubated at VentureLab.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've strong skills in <abbr>HTML5</abbr> and <abbr>CSS3</abbr> and I'm a decent JavaScript developper. I love building things, and make them look beautiful (however the resolution).
      </p>
      <p>
        But words are what they are, so why don't you take a look to my <a href="https://lasmala.be" title="Take a look to my latest piece of work">latest piece of work</a> instead of reading a boring text? Of course, feel free to run one Lighthouse audit.

        Skills I have
      </h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Strong skills in <abbr>HTML5</abbr> and <abbr>CSS3</abbr>, focusing on delivering high-end user experience, however the resolution is. I make the extra mile to provide optimized code for <abbr>SEO</abbr>, performance and accessibility. 
          I make <abbr>W3C</abbr> valid code and adapt myself easily to the <abbr>CSS</abbr> technology or framework (<abbr>SASS</abbr>, <abbr>LESS CSS</abbr>, Tailwind or whatever) and / or methodology (BEM, RSCSS or whatever) used in the project. I love to work on <abbr>CSS</abbr> animation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Decent skills in Vanilla JavaScript (<abbr>ES6+</abbr>). But as JavaScript is a rabbit hole, I still can dig in it!
        </li>
        <li>
          I'm not a designer but I've a sharp eye and I use Figma daily. I always try to make the best UX possible.
        </li>
        <li>
          I use Git (mostly without GitHub desktop) and I'm not afraid of the command-line.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some knowledge with Svelte.js framework  (I'm currently rewriting a fullstack side project made in VanillaJS and Node.js with Svelte).
        </li>
        <li>
          Some knowledge in back-end, using Node.js (with Express).
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>Let's meet in real-life! I can come to visit your agency and drink a coffee to talk a bit more and showcase you some of my previous work (if you're interested).</p>
